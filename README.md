🔍 Project Overview
I built a custom dataset by pulling candidate-specific Google ad spend data in all 50 states, paired with public demographic and voter registration data including:

State population

Median household income

Education levels

Party registration (Democrat & Republican)

Voter turnout

Final election winner

Using this data, I applied logistic regression models to predict election outcomes and identify which features had the most predictive power.

🎯 Mock Ad Campaign Trial
To validate the real-world influence of ad exposure, I designed a mock trial in which 14 students were shown a custom ad I built for one candidate (Candidate A). After viewing the ad, students were asked to vote. The results showed that Candidate A—who was the only one shown—won with a 37% voting rate, reinforcing the influence of advertising on voter decision-making.

📊 Skills Applied
Data scraping and aggregation

Logistic regression and predictive modeling

Data cleaning and feature engineering

First-party experiment design

Visualizations and results interpretation

🧠 Key Takeaways
Ad spend was a strong predictor of electoral success in the model.

Demographics like education level and party registration also showed significant influence.

The mock trial highlighted how even minimal ad exposure can influence decision-making in a controlled environment.
